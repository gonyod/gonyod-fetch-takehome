Hi!

I was exploring the products, users, and transactions data and noticed some weirdness. I think some of the underlying 
infrastrucutre tables for the transactions data failed to run overnight, which resulted in missing sales and barcode data.
I'm concerned that this will lead to inaccurate reporting and mislabeled power users on the app. I also noticed duplicate 
receipt_ids, which could be a further side effect of upstream pipeline issues (or another issue entirely -- happy to 
investigate further!). The tables aren't the most well-defined, so I had a little trouble understanding the scope of the 
categories in the products table. It's not immediately clear if they are nested subcategories or if they are independent
categories where order doesn't matter. Do you have any thoughts there?

I did find it very interesting how few receipts even our power users have logged. According to this data, the max number
of receipts logged by a user is 3 -- this doesn't seem in line with what I'd expect from our power users. This trend is
concerning, and I think we should start brainstorming ways to increase retention in our users.

Next steps here are to continue investigating the pipeline issue I mentioned, and I'll set up a meeting for us to chat as a
larger group about the user retention issue. It'd be super helpful for me if you could pass along column definitions for these
tables so I can make sure I'm not misunderstanding any of the data. 

Thanks so much!
